# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and attempts to guess the number based on user feedback.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the `guess_number.py` file.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following command to start the game:

   ```shell
   python guess_number.py
   ```

4. The program will prompt you to think of a number between 1 and 100. Type 'ok' and press Enter to start the game.

5. The program will make guesses and ask for feedback. Respond with one of the following options:
   - `>` if the number is higher than the guess.
   - `<` if the number is lower than the guess.
   - `=` if the guess is correct.

6. Keep providing feedback until the program correctly guesses the number. The program will display the number of attempts it took to guess the number.
